        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Why do we need Changemakers? A quick glance around us reveals a world of poor roads, potholes, overflowing drains, frothing lakes and everything seems on the brink of an apocalypse, and everyone seems anxious and stressed. However, change is slow and has to be fostered at all levels in order to be lasting.  Our youth are our future and igniting their passion for grappling with the messy problems that they will inherit will help us develop socially responsible citizens of tomorrow. As Richard Branson says, ‘Once a change maker, always a change maker, but only a few swim against the tide.’<br>We strongly believe that all of us can channel our passions to swim upstream and bring about change in our own spheres of influence. Our goal is to create change makers all around Bengaluru who will be the change they want to see in this world.</span></div>

        <div class="collapsible-header orange lighten-1"><i class="material-icons">book</i>History</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>We started Changemaker with Our Safety Our Voice:  In 2014, the city was shocked by gruesome incidents around child safety (and lack thereof) in schools around Bangalore. The city witnessed a sudden surge in reports of child abuse cases at schools.  In response to this, students  from Inventure and other schools met together to help form the charter on Child Safety that was submitted and adopted by the Karnataka legislative bodies.  About 1100 students from different schools, and economic strata were contacted and provided their input to surveys.<br>Next we started Our Lakes Our Voice:  In 2015, children from our school as well as other neighbouring schools and schools from the US (through the American Indian Foundation) did an empathy walk around Lake Varthur which is in our neighborhood and extremely polluted.  After learning about the lake and the people living around it, students were very passionate about working on this cause.  One of our students, Sahithi Pingali, won several awards including, a gold medal at ISWEEP (International Sustainable World Engineering Environment Project) for her research on “An Innovative Crowdsourcing Approach to Monitoring Freshwater Bodies.”  In addition, the Our Lakes Our Voice initiative is supported by a fully functioning water testing lab and students have been able to test water along many parameters including BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand).  BOD is a key parameter to gauging sewage content in water and it is unusual for high school students to have access to equipment that tests BOD content and learn the procedures behind testing for this parameter.  Students plan to roll out free testing to more areas of Bangalore (via our school bus system) and eventually build a database of water quality in Bangalore.  They are also exploring the idea of inviting students from other schools to test water in our water testing lab. Students have also built an Our Lakes Our Voice website.<br>Professor Saras from Darden School UVA (and author of Effectuation: Elements of Entrepreneurial Expertise) has worked with our students to teach them to be more effective. We also have a team of mentors and faculty (including an ex Google Product Manager) who help the students with their projects. As a result, many students created initiatives around causes for which they were passionate -all within the Changemaker platform. These projects include:<br><ul><li>Our Traffic Our Voice which helped to optimize our bus routes, increased carpooling awareness and public transportation at school.  as well as increase carpooling</li>
        <li>All Paws on Deck which helps adoption of dogs in shelters</li>
        <li>Involve which tries to improve the quality of education in Government schools through technology</li>
        <li>Chain Reaction which helps peers teach peers difficult Maths and Science concepts at our school</li>
        <li>In 2017, we piloted the Changemaker Challenge for high school students all across Bangalore.  You can read more about it <a href="2017.html">here</a></li></ul></span></div>
